Bayesian Optimization for VAFW CYLinders (bovafwcyl)
===

This respository contains the revised code originally created in Aravind Ashok's MSc thesis ( http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:f0b2cdec-d5d8-4d98-83fe-da1f3ffc8d6d )
entitled "Bayesian Optimization for Lightweight Design of Variable Stiffness Composite Cylinder". We focused on variable-angle filament wound cylinders (VAFW).

The code has been cleaned-up and heavily simplified and re-structured.

The finite element being used to discretize the problem is the SC-BFSC, available on GitHub ( https://github.com/saullocastro/bfsccylinder ).

Before running this code
---
Make sure to install the following libraries:

    python -m pip install numpy openmdao scipy skopt sklearn composites bfsccylinder

How to run the Bayesian optimization code?
---
The main file to be run is the `bovafwcyl.py`:

    python bovafwcyl.py


Changing parameters for the Bayesian optimizer
---
Geometry, inside `bovafwcyl.py`, look for the `geo_dict` variable:

    geo_dict = dict(
        L=0.300, # length
        R=0.15 # radius
    )


Material properties, look for the `mat_dict` variable:

    mat_dict = dict(
        E11=90e9,
        E22=7e9,
        nu12=0.32,
        G12=4.4e9,
        G23=1.8e9,
        plyt=0.4e-3 # ply thickness
    )

Number of layers and design loads, look for the `layers_loads` variable:

    layers_loads = (
                    (1,  50e3),
                    (2, 100e3),
                    (2, 200e3),
                    (2, 500e3),
                    (3, 200e3),
                    (3, 500e3),
                    (3, 1000e3),
                    (4, 500e3),
                    (4, 1000e3)
                    )

Discretization level, currently controlled by the number of elements along the
circumferential direction `ny`, look for the following variables, where the
defaul values are recommended, based on previous convergence analyses:

    ny_init_sampling = 55
    ny_optimization = 55
    ny_verification = 65


How to run the genetic algorithm (GA) optimizer?
---
The main file to be run is the `openmdao_GA.py`:

    python openmdao_GA.py

This will create pickle files with names like:

    GA_0050_kN_best_individual.pickle
    GA_0050_kN_individuals.pickle

You can then post-process these optimization results using either of the two:

    python openmdao_GA_post.py
    Pickle_CSV.py to get pickle files data into .cv for easy view and understanding

Changing parameters for the genetic algorithm
---
Maximum number of generations and population size, inside `openmdao_GA.py`,
look for the `max_gen` and `pop_size` attributes of the `MyGA` class:
    
    self.max_gen = 100
    self.pop_size = 25


Geometry, look for the `geo_dict` attribute of the `MyGA` class:

    self.geo_dict = dict(
        L=0.300, # length
        R=0.15 # radius
    )

Material properties, look for the `mat_dict` attribute:

    self.mat_dict = dict(
        E11=90e9,
        E22=7e9,
        nu12=0.32,
        G12=4.4e9,
        G23=1.8e9,
        plyt=0.4e-3 # ply thickness
    )

Design loads, in both files `openmdao_GA.py` and `openmdao_GA_post.py`, look
for the `design_loads` list:

    design_loads = [
        50e3,
        100e3,
        200e3,
        500e3,
        1000e3,
    ]

Discretization level, currently controlled by the number of elements along the
circumferential direction `ny`, look for the following attribute of the `MyGA`
class, where the defaul corresponds to what is being used for the Bayesian
optimization:

    self.ny = 55
